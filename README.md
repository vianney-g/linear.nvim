# linear.nvim

Author: Vianney Gremmel

Linear navigation from inside vim.

## âš  This is a work in progress.


## Installation

Install with your favorite plugin manager.

Example with [folke/lazy.nvim]: 

```lua
use {
  'vianney-g/linear.nvim',
  requires = {
    'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim',
    'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim',
  },
  config = function()
    require'linear'.setup()
  end
}
```

The call to `setup()` will prompt you for your Linear API key at the first call.

## Usage

Until now the only use case is to fuzzy find issue to copy the attached branch name to the current buffer.
(more to come).


Fuzzy search for issues assigned to you:

```vim
:lua require'linear'.issues{assignee = 'me'}
```

Fuzzy search for issues belonging to a team:

```vim
:lua require'linear'.issues{team = 'TEAM'}
```

This will open a Telescope finder.
